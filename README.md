# MinPy_edu - optimization library for research and education
this is the implementation of theoretical approach described in paper kapl.pdf (in this repository). Different aspects of this approach are discussed in the following papers
A.I. Kaplinskii and A.I. Propoi. Nonlocal optimization methods that use potential theory. Avtomat. i Telemekh., 7:55-65, 1993.
A.I. Kaplinskii and A.I. Propoi. Second-order refinement conditions in nonlocal optimization methods that use potential theory. Avtomat. i Telemekh., 8:104-117, 1994.

This library is under construction! We plan to add more building blocks,

Please check minpy_getting_started_example.py to see how to construct custom algorithms using minpy building blocks
Currently minpy library consists of two python files, minpy.py ( building blocks for the algorithm) and optfun.py (test functions)
