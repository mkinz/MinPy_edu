# MinPy_edu
optimization library for research and education
this is the implementation of theoretical approach described in the papers

A.I. Kaplinskii and A.I. Propoi. Nonlocal optimization methods that use potential theory. Avtomat. i Telemekh., 7:55-65, 1993.

This library is under construction! We plan to add more building blocks,

Please check minpy_getting_started_example.py to see how to construct custom algorithms using minpy building blocks
