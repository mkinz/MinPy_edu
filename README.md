# MinPy_edu - optimization library for research and education
this is the implementation of theoretical approach described in paper kapl.pdf (in this repository). Different aspects of this approach are discussed in the following papers, also in this repositry (kapl_first_order.pdf, kapl_second_order.pdf

For application of the methods in machine learning see this paper:

This library is under construction! We plan to add more building blocks,

Please check minpy_getting_started_example.py to see how to construct custom algorithms using minpy building blocks
Currently minpy library consists of two python files, minpy.py ( building blocks for the algorithm) and optfun.py (test functions)
