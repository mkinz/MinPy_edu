
Objective:

this course will introduce students to currently existing optimization strategies and their software implementations, and build intuitive understanding of their similarities and differences, to be able to design new optimization strategies with desired properties.
Use cases from behavioral economics, Robotics, design of experiments and machne learning will be discussed.

Course Mode:
Video records as introductions to each topic(5 lectures, 10 min each)
Suggested Projects ( video records are available for project explanation)

Tools: Python, ScipPy, Tensorflow, MinPy_edu
